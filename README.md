# Garlic Bread

### This script is my first attempt at making a complete cheat using LMAOBOX's Lua API

---

#### Build instructions

You shouldn't need to build the script manually, see <span style="color: green">Releases</span> page to find a file that works right

- Requirements:
npm
luabundler
a way to run bash scripts

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uosq/lbox-garlic-bread.git
cd lbox-garlic-bread
chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

The file is exported to: <span style="color: maroon">build/garlic-bread.lua</span>

## TODO:

- GUI
- Stop using console commands to configure the cheat (its ugly)
- ESP
- CHAMS
- GLOW (not sure if i'll add it)
- TRIGGERBOT
- AUTOBACKSTAB
- More...
