# Garlic Bread

### This script is my first attempt at making a complete cheat using LMAOBOX's Lua API

---

#### Build instructions

It's recommended to use Linux to build the project, but 

- Requirements:
npm
luabundler
a way to run bash scripts

```bash
	git clone https://github.com/uosq/lbox-garlic-bread.git
	cd lbox-garlic-bread
	chmod u+x build.sh
	./build.sh
```

The file is exported to: `build/garlic-bread.lua`

## TODO:

- GUI
- Stop using console commands to configure the cheat (its ugly)
- ESP
- CHAMS
- GLOW (not sure if i'll add it)
- TRIGGERBOT
