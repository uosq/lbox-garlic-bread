# Garlic Bread

### This script is my first attempt at making a complete cheat using LMAOBOX's Lua API

---

Special thanks to Glitch :)

#### Build instructions

You shouldn't need to build the script manually, see $\textcolor{green}{\textsf{Releases}}$ page to find a file that works right

**Requirements:**

- npm
- luabundler
- a way to run bash scripts

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uosq/lbox-garlic-bread.git
cd lbox-garlic-bread
chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

The file is exported to $\color{maroon}{\textsf{build/garlic-bread.lua}}$

## TODO:

- GUI
- Stop using console commands to configure the cheat (its ugly)
- More...
